# ADM_homework2
This homework is made up of 4 files:
1. The readme ( this one) in which we are going to explain all the contents of our repository
2. support_functions.py which contains all the support functions we had used during the assignment
3. Homework.ipynb where contains all the answers to our research and theoretical questions divided in 8 Research questions and 3 Theorethical questions 
4. .gitignore to avoid uploading our datasets which are the original one 'steam_reviews' and the final one obtained by merging three given datasets 'steam_reviews', 'steam_revies_bonus1','steam_review_bonus2' which is restricted to the columns we use during the assignment. This last dataframe is stored on our personal computer but we can provide a csv file if necessary
